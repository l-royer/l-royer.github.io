 ##                 The Relevance of JavaScript and Athletic Software Engineering

        As a relatively new student aiming to improve my competency within the computer science field,
    I recognize the significance of studying JavaScript and utilizing the athletic software engineering
    learning style. The “Basic JavaScript” modules on freeCodeCamp provided me with my first major 
    experience with JavaScript. I previously had a short encounter with the language when I explored
    how JavaScript, CSS, and HTML worked together to display a very basic webpage. I found that moment,
    and the few JS-based WODS we’ve done thus far in this class, to be of the more exciting moments of
    coding for me. Although I did not know how to code and did not have any computer science background,
    I switched my major to ICS last January on a whim. While I glean satisfaction from coding in the same
    way I do from solving puzzles, my experience with coding has been limited to the abstract, small-scale
    assignments from introductory computer science courses. JavaScript, as the necessary component of
    website development, lets me experience coding on a practical and “real” level. I enjoy seeing the
    immediate, real-time results of what I type, and that I can actually extrapolate my code to a relevant
    application.
    
    
       As I have only been coding for a year, I am hesitant to consider myself knowledgeable enough
    to properly compare it with other languages. I can say that I enjoy the simplicity of JavaScript,
    and how the language isn’t strongly typed. Learning C in ICS212, and how it works as a low-level
    language, allows me to appreciate the flexibility JavaScript has – but I do anticipate frustration
    in the event I want to narrow down the specifics of why and how the minute parts work. I am partial
    towards specific, consistent structure that builds off of itself. For this reason, I also disliked
    learning Java (although that experience could certainly be attributed to the crash-course nature of
    an ICS 101 class). Thus, I think JavaScript is valuable from a software perspective in that it is 
    efficient and simple, but limited in its ability to identify errors or specific mechanics. I am 
    excited to implement real projects using this practical language.
        Athletic software engineering is a new and challenging concept for me. I struggle to find 
      comfortability with coding because I am hyper aware of both my lack of computer science experience
      in comparison to my peers and of the rigorous caliber of technical interviews in the career field.
      I find doing anything within a time constraint extremely stressful, and I am prone to mistakes
      under pressure. Thus, I see great value in the premise of athletic software engineering; I am
      able to gain experience in being tested in problem-solving and coding within a limited amount
      of time, but in a low-stakes environment. WODs and practice WODs are very useful for cultivating
      not only the knowledge and efficiency required to be successful in the future, but also the
      comfortability that I desire. When I finish WODs within a desirable timeframe or ahead of my
      peers, I gain a sense of confidence that allows me to actually identify with being a “computer
      scientist” and quell any reservations I have about pushing myself further in this field. These
      sorts of practical exercises lend the experience I didn’t know I needed.
