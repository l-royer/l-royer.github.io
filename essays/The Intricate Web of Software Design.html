<p>Have you ever tried to compose software for a real-world application requiring numerous interacting components and classes? If so, you may have realized what once seemed like a straightforward problem with a logical approach often quickly becomes a convoluted, spider’s web of information overload. In these scenarios, the best way out of these logical mazes is through an established path. Such pathways are essentially design patterns in programming. By following the conventions of previously established solutions, much time and headaches can be solved when it comes to designing software architecture.</p>

<p>Design patterns are essentially a set of reusable solutions to commonly occurring software design problems. They provide a proven and efficient way to solve specific types of problems in software development. Design patterns can be considered as templates for solving programming challenges that can be applied to various situations. They are intended to solve problems that arise during the software development process, such as how to create flexible and maintainable software architectures, how to manage complex interactions between software components, and how to design software that is easily extensible and scalable.</p>

<p>I begin designing software by analyzing the components that I have used before in previous projects, and dissect how they interface with each other and other data structures. After discerning the divergences between the former architecture and the functionality I require for my current project, I attempt to solve any discrepancies by formulating an amalgamation of the structures and functionalities I’ve used before. Through this process, I am able to minimize the amount of risky, new software leaps by basing the majority of the architecture on tried and true solutions. This also allows me to quickly and effectively recognize program structure in various new applications. Thus, design patterns are integral to software engineering efficiency.</p>
