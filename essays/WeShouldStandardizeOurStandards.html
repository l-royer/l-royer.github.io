<p>If proper command of the English language is determined by precise diction, syntax, and flow, then why should computer programming languages be exempt from such convention? The process of meeting coding standards may be tedious and time-consuming, but standards are necessary for clarity. Some coding standards exist purely for stylistic choices, and the practicality of these requirements are reasonably debated. Variations in style don’t affect how your computer reads your code, and some may disagree with what is considered to be more visually efficient. But how much time is wasted when a programmer attempts to decipher unclear code? How many mistakes are unnecessarily created because of the limitations of poor readability? If style didn’t matter, then code could be written the same way essays are: in long blocks of jumbled words, separated only by single-spaces and the occasional paragraph indentation. However, the general consensus of the programming community is opposed to this, and for good reason.</p>

<p>The same logic ought to be extended to coding standards that extend beyond inserting newlines and indentations. One of the most difficult aspects of learning how to code is the lack of consistency. In one class, curly braces are only allowed on their own separate lines, while in another, curly braces may follow the code in the same line. Some argue that the former leaves no doubt as to what data is encapsulated where, while others argue that the latter takes up less space and is therefore easier to look at. Whatever the logic, switching between either style to meet a particular programmer’s expectation is a hassle. In English, speakers don’t decide to forgo commas or proper spellings in favor of one they personally find to be easier to understand. There is, after all, a substantial difference between the sentences “let’s eat, grandma” and “let’s eat grandma.” Coding standards would do well to be even more standardized. If we collectively chose one way to format our code, we would save insurmountable amounts of time not having to code-switch mentally whenever we programmed for different clients, decipher someone else’s coding style, or learn a new one.</p>

<p>I appreciate programs like ESLint and checkstyle, which stick to one standard applied across the board. It would be even more useful if each editor had the same requirements. Navigating between various editors allows us to become comfortable in one style, and rudely disrupted when we’re required to use another. Programmers may argue that coding, as their passion, should be personalized as any other art would be. But while the English language can be artful in its use of prose and flow, grammar and spelling are still maintained. So it should be the same in computer programming. The art of coding should come from the elegance of a solution, not in its placement of spaces or brackets. I advocate for a strict, consistent set of coding standards, which will save more time and frustration than having multiple diverse and optional coding standards does.</p>
