# My Future In Software Engineering
 
 With every moment that I gain experience in software engineering, I realize there is so much more I have yet to learn. The endless possibilities that accompany software engineering, such as app, website, or software development, lend so much choice and freedom that I feel it is too restricting to have to choose one field to specialize in. The expectation that I already have a sense of what I want to do with the rest of my life in this field is rather alarming. As a new computer scientist, I want to be exposed to as many software engineering avenues as I can. Consequently, I'm interested in just about everything.
 
 
 I find the creative nature of videogame development intriguing, the danger of cyber security exciting, and the society-shattering implications of AI deeply enticing. I would love to gain experience with data science to pursue research, or perhaps delve into bioinformatics. App and website development interest me when I consider all of the different programs I wish I had at my disposal. I'm also taken by the idea of being able to program my own basic 'smart' home appliances, so as to avoid the third-party access of private information that goes hand-in-hand with using appliances that belong to big corporations. I also am of the unpopular opionion that robots taking over would be a great thing -- and I would love to help them! 
 
 ### Looking Forward
 At my current skill and experience level, I'm like a blank canvas in dire need of some paint. As much as I can fantasize about becoming an expert in machine learning or data science, I have a long road ahead of me. I am still in the process of trying to find comfortable standing in an ever-changing field of some of the most complex, abstract technological concepts. I need to increase my technical skills, and learn to code elegantly and efficiently. I also need to add more languages to my repertoire, and stay up to date with the newest technologies and systems. Over the course of the next year, I'm hoping to achieve the familiarity I so desire through my classes, extra-curricular computer science clubs, and internships.
