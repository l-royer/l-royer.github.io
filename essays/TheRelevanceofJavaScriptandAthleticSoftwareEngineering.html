<p>As a relatively new student aiming to improve my competency within the computer science field, I recognize the significance of studying JavaScript and utilizing the athletic software engineering learning style. The “Basic JavaScript” modules on freeCodeCamp provided me with my first major experience with JavaScript. I previously had a short encounter with the language when I explored how JavaScript, CSS, and HTML worked together to display a very basic webpage. I found that moment, and the few JS-based WODS we’ve done thus far in this class, to be of the more exciting moments of coding for me. Although I did not know how to code and did not have any computer science background, I switched my major to ICS last January on a whim. While I glean satisfaction from coding in the same way I do from solving puzzles, my experience with coding has been limited to the abstract, small-scale assignments from introductory computer science courses. JavaScript, as the necessary component of website development, lets me experience coding on a practical and “real” level. I enjoy seeing the immediate, real-time results of what I type, and that I can actually extrapolate my code to a relevant application.</p>

<p>As I have only been coding for a year, I am hesitant to consider myself knowledgeable enough to properly compare it with other languages. I can say that I enjoy the simplicity of JavaScript, and how the language isn’t strongly typed. Learning C in ICS212, and how it works as a low-level language, allows me to appreciate the flexibility JavaScript has – but I do anticipate frustration in the event I want to narrow down the specifics of why and how the minute parts work. I am partial towards specific, consistent structure that builds off of itself. For this reason, I also disliked learning Java (although that experience could certainly be attributed to the crash-course nature of an ICS 101 class). Thus, I think JavaScript is valuable from a software perspective in that it is efficient and simple, but limited in its ability to identify errors or specific mechanics. I am excited to implement real projects using this practical language.</p>

<h3 id="on-athletic-software-engineering">On Athletic Software Engineering</h3>
<p>Athletic software engineering is a new and challenging concept for me. I struggle to find comfortability with coding because I am hyper aware of both my lack of computer science experience in comparison to my peers and of the rigorous caliber of technical interviews in the career field. I find doing anything within a time constraint extremely stressful, and I am prone to mistakes under pressure. Thus, I see great value in the premise of athletic software engineering; I am able to gain experience in being tested in problem-solving and coding within a limited amount of time, but in a low-stakes environment. WODs and practice WODs are very useful for cultivating not only the knowledge and efficiency required to be successful in the future, but also the comfortability that I desire. When I finish WODs within a desirable timeframe or ahead of my peers, I gain a sense of confidence that allows me to actually identify with being a “computer scientist” and quell any reservations I have about pushing myself further in this field. These sorts of practical exercises lend the experience I didn’t know I needed.</p>
