# Homework Checlist Coding Tutorial
Homework Checklist is a beginner-level tutorial for a project meant to exemplify how to use DOM to modify HTML events at a basic level. This tutorial is meant for middle and high school students with a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Students are meant to follow the step by step instructions to create their own homework checklists, personalized to include their own homework assignments. The checklist can display the assignment name, the amount of time estimated for each assignment, and be deleted when completed. 
 
I wrote and provided index and style documents for students to start off with. I also provide a script template with instructions indicating which elements they should edit and the method they should use. This allows students to focus on the core concepts of how to manipulate DOM to affect HTML elements. At this introductory level, students are only expected to modify existing HTML elements, rather than create new ones. The wrote the index file to contain a background that resembles a checklist, and a list of text items that correspond to the assignments to be completed. Each item is part of a button class that enables the item to be deleted when clicked, replicating a digital version of "crossing off" completed assignments. The script file contains instructions showing students how to access various eleemnts by ID and class name, modify style, create and append text nodes, and disable attributes.

As this was my first project with website development, I learned so much about the same concepts I am attempting to communicate to beginner students. Although the project is simple tutorial from a student's point of view, I had to learn how to structure and manipulate HTML, and connect these elements with CSS and Javascript. Because I lacked any prior background experience in software engineering, I had to locate the available resources so that I could teach myself how to use these languages. I also learned what I couldn't take for granted: what I believed to be simple design aspects were actually nuanced and detailed, and I was actually forced to think artistically about the type of styles that I wanted. As I had free range to write any sort of project tutorial, I was also allowed the freedom to think creatively about the realistic application of coding.
